# CDOJeepney Environment Configuration
# 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Copy this file: cp env.template .env
# 2. Or create .env.local (takes priority over .env)
# 3. Update VITE_OTP_BASE with your OTP server URL
# 4. Restart dev server after any changes (npm run dev)
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env files to the repository!
# For deployment: Set these variables in your hosting platform's dashboard
# (Vercel, Netlify, etc.) - see README.md for deployment instructions

# OpenTripPlanner Base URL
# Replace with your actual OTP server URL (e.g., https://your-otp-server.com)
VITE_OTP_BASE=https://your-otp-server.com
 
# OTP GraphQL Endpoints (can be derived or explicit)
# If not set, will be auto-constructed from VITE_OTP_BASE
# But it's safer to set them explicitly as shown below
VITE_OTP_GTFS_GQL=${VITE_OTP_BASE}/otp/gtfs/v1

# NOTE: If you only set VITE_OTP_BASE, the code will auto-construct the full URLs
# But it's safer to set them explicitly as shown above

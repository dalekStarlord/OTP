# Vercel Deployment Guide

This project is now ready to deploy on Vercel!

## Quick Deploy

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for Vercel deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Import to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Click "Add New Project"
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will run `npm install` and `npm run build`
   - Your app will be live in minutes!

## What Was Fixed

The following TypeScript errors were preventing deployment:

1. ✅ Removed unused `markerColor` variable in `SearchBox.tsx`
2. ✅ Fixed implicit `any` types in `polyline.ts`
3. ✅ Created type declarations for `@mapbox/polyline` module
4. ✅ Added `vercel.json` configuration file
5. ✅ Added `.vercelignore` for optimized deployments

## Environment Variables

If you need to add environment variables:
1. Go to your Vercel project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add variables as needed (e.g., API keys)

## Build Output

- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Framework: Vite

## Troubleshooting

If deployment fails:
1. Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Ensure TypeScript compiles locally: `npx tsc --noEmit`
4. Test the build locally: `npm run build`

## Local Preview

To preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

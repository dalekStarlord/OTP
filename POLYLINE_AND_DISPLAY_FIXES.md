# Polyline and Display Fixes

## ✅ **Changes Applied**

### 1. **Updated ngrok URL** ✅
Changed from: `https://9776907978a6.ngrok-free.app`  
Changed to: `https://8acea3d2d414.ngrok-free.app`

**Files Updated:**
- ✅ `.env.local` - Environment variables (primary source)
- ✅ `src/lib/otp.ts` - Fallback URL (line 4)
- ✅ `env.template` - Template for reference
- ✅ `test-api.html` - Test page URLs

### 2. **Fixed: Only Show Selected Itinerary Route** ✅

**Problem:** All route polylines were showing on the map, making it confusing which route you selected.

**Solution:** Modified `MapView.tsx` to only render polylines for:
- The currently selected itinerary
- OR the hovered itinerary (for preview)

**Code Change:**
```tsx
// Before: All itineraries shown
{itineraries?.map((itinerary) => {
  return <ItineraryPolylines itinerary={itinerary} />
})}

// After: Only selected/hovered shown
{itineraries?.map((itinerary) => {
  const isSelected = itinerary.id === selectedItineraryId;
  const isHovered = itinerary.id === hoveredItineraryId;
  
  // Only render if selected or hovered
  if (!isSelected && !isHovered) return null;
  
  return <ItineraryPolylines itinerary={itinerary} />
})}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Click an itinerary → **only that route shows**
- ✅ Hover an itinerary → **preview that route**
- ✅ Much clearer which route you're looking at

### 3. **Fixed: Crooked Polylines (Precision Issue)** ✅

**Problem:** Polylines don't match roads and appear crooked/jagged.

**Root Cause:** OTP can encode polylines with different precision levels:
- Precision 5: 1 meter accuracy (most common)
- Precision 6: 10cm accuracy (higher detail)

The library defaults to precision 5, but your OTP might use precision 6.

**Solution:** Smart polyline decoder that:
1. Tries precision 5 first (default)
2. Validates coordinates are in Philippines bounds
3. If invalid, automatically tries precision 6
4. Logs which precision was used

**Code Change:**
```typescript
// Before: Fixed precision 5
const decoded = polyline.decode(encoded);

// After: Auto-detect precision
let decoded = polyline.decode(encoded, 5);

// Validate coordinates (Philippines: lat 4-21, lon 116-127)
const isValid = decoded.every(([lat, lon]) => 
  lat >= 4 && lat <= 21 && lon >= 116 && lon <= 127
);

// Try precision 6 if precision 5 fails
if (!isValid) {
  decoded = polyline.decode(encoded, 6);
}
```

**Result:**
- ✅ Automatically uses correct precision
- ✅ Polylines should follow roads accurately
- ✅ Console logs if precision 6 is needed

### 4. **Improved: Route Visual Styling** ✅

Made routes more visible and distinguishable:

**Bus Routes:**
- Color: Red (#ef4444) instead of blue - more visible
- Weight: 5px (was 4px) - thicker
- Opacity: 0.85 (was 0.8)
- Selected: Dark red (#dc2626), 7px thick, 100% opacity

**Walk Segments:**
- Color: Gray (#888888)
- Weight: 4px
- Dashed: 8px dash, 8px gap
- Selected: Darker gray, 6px thick

**Why These Changes:**
- ✅ Red is easier to see against map background
- ✅ Thicker lines easier to follow
- ✅ Clear visual difference between bus and walk
- ✅ Selected route stands out dramatically

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Restart Dev Server** (REQUIRED)
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

### **Step 2: Plan a Route**
1. Set From and To locations (map click or search)
2. Click "Get Routes"
3. You'll see multiple itinerary options at bottom

### **Step 3: Test Single Route Display**
1. **Click on any itinerary card** at the bottom
2. **Expected:** Only that route's polylines appear on map
3. **Hover** over another itinerary
4. **Expected:** Preview of that route (without clicking)
5. **Click** a different itinerary
6. **Expected:** Old route disappears, new route shows

### **Step 4: Check Polyline Accuracy**
1. After selecting a route, zoom in on the map
2. **Check:** Do the red lines follow the actual roads?
3. **Check browser console (F12):**
   - If you see "Trying precision 6" → OTP is using precision 6
   - No message → Precision 5 worked

## 🔍 **About the Crooked Polylines Issue**

### **Is it the OTP Graph or the Code?**

It could be **either**, but most likely it's a **precision mismatch**:

### **Scenario 1: Precision Mismatch** ✅ FIXED
- **Symptom:** Lines are jagged, don't follow roads at all
- **Cause:** Decoding with wrong precision
- **Fix:** Auto-detect precision (now implemented)

### **Scenario 2: OSM Data Quality**
- **Symptom:** Lines mostly follow roads but have gaps/jumps
- **Cause:** Incomplete or outdated OSM data in OTP graph
- **Fix:** Rebuild OTP graph with better OSM data
- **How to check:** Compare routes in different areas - if some areas are perfect and others aren't, it's OSM data

### **Scenario 3: GTFS vs Real Roads**
- **Symptom:** Straight lines between stops instead of following roads
- **Cause:** OTP graph doesn't have proper street routing
- **Fix:** Ensure OSM data is included when building OTP graph
- **How to check:** Walk segments should follow sidewalks/paths, not straight lines

### **How to Tell Which Issue You Have:**

After restart:

**If lines now follow roads perfectly:**
→ ✅ It was precision mismatch (fixed!)

**If lines still don't match roads:**
→ Check console for "Trying precision 6" message
→ If you see it, precision 6 is being used
→ If lines still wrong, it's likely OSM data quality in graph

**If you see straight lines between stops:**
→ OTP graph needs to be rebuilt with OSM street data
→ This is an OTP server configuration issue, not code

---

## 🛠️ **If OTP Graph Needs Rebuilding**

### **Signs you need to rebuild the graph:**

1. ✅ Precision auto-detection logs show correct precision
2. ❌ But polylines still don't follow roads
3. ❌ Routes go through buildings or water
4. ❌ Straight lines instead of curved roads

### **How to Fix (OTP Server Side):**

When building your OTP graph, ensure you include:

```bash
# build-config.json should have:
{
  "osm": [
    {
      "source": "philippines-latest.osm.pbf",  # OSM data
      "osmWayPropertySet": "default"
    }
  ],
  "transitFeeds": [
    {
      "source": "gtfs.zip",  # Your GTFS data
      "type": "GTFS"
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure:
- ✅ OSM file covers Cagayan de Oro area
- ✅ OSM file is recent (< 6 months old)
- ✅ Graph build completed without errors

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now**

### **Route Display:**
1. Click "Get Routes" → See itinerary cards at bottom

3. Hover another itinerary → **Preview it** (without clearing current)
4. Click different itinerary → **Switch to that route**

### **Route Appearance:**
- **Bus segments:** Bold red line following roads
- **Walk segments:** Gray dashed line

## 🔄 **Next Time ngrok URL Changes**

Just update one file: `.env.local`

```env
VITE_OTP_BASE=https://YOUR_NEW_URL.ngrok-free.app
```

Then restart: `npm run dev`

That's it! ✅

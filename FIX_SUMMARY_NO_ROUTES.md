# Fix Summary: "No Routes Found" Issue

## ✅ **All Fixes Applied**

I've implemented several fixes to resolve the "No routes found" issue and make debugging easier.

---

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed**

### 1. **ngrok CORS Headers** ✅
**Problem:** ngrok shows a warning page that blocks API requests

**Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// src/lib/otp.ts
headers: { 
  'content-type': 'application/json',
  'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': 'true'  // ← Bypasses ngrok warning
}
```

### 2. **Enhanced Logging** ✅
**Problem:** No visibility into what's failing

**Fix Applied:**
Added comprehensive console logging:
- 🎯 Route planning start (shows coordinates & settings)
- 🚀 API requests (shows URL & variables)
- ✅ Successful responses
- ❌ Detailed error messages
- 📊 Result summaries

### 3. **Better Error Messages** ✅
**Problem:** Generic "No routes found" doesn't help diagnose

**Fix Applied:**
Now shows specific errors:
```
No routes found. Errors: Transmodel: Network error, GTFS: Invalid coordinates
```

### 4. **TypeScript Definitions** ✅
**Problem:** TypeScript errors on import.meta.env

**Fix Applied:**
Created `src/vite-env.d.ts` with proper Vite environment typings

---

## 🚀 **REQUIRED: Restart Dev Server**

**Environment variables and code changes require a restart:**

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

⚠️ **MUST RESTART** - Changes won't work without it!

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. Open http://localhost:5173
2. Press `F12` (or right-click → Inspect)
3. Click **Console** tab
4. **Keep it open** while testing

### Step 2: Plan a Route

#### Option A: Using Map Click
1. Click 📍 pin next to "From"
2. Click on map (downtown CDO area)
3. Click 📍 pin next to "To"
4. Click on map (uptown CDO area)
5. Click "Get Routes"

#### Option B: Using Search
1. Type "divisoria" in From field
2. Select from dropdown
3. Type "sm cdo" in To field
4. Select from dropdown
5. Click "Get Routes"

### Step 3: Check Console Output

**✅ If Working, You'll See:**
```
🎯 Starting route planning: { from: {...}, to: {...} }
🚀 Transmodel Request: { url: "https://9776907978a6...", variables: {...} }
✅ Transmodel Response: { trip: { tripPatterns: [3 items] } }
🚀 GTFS Request: { url: "https://9776907978a6...", variables: {...} }
✅ GTFS Response: { plan: { itineraries: [2 items] } }
📊 Results: { transmodelCount: 3, gtfsCount: 2, combinedCount: 5, errors: [] }
✅ Successfully planned 5 routes
```

**❌ If Still Failing, You'll See:**
```
🎯 Starting route planning: ...
🚀 Transmodel Request: ...
❌ Transmodel trip planning error: [Specific error]
Error details: { message: "...", stack: "..." }
📊 Results: { errors: ["Transmodel: ..."] }
```

## 🔍 **Common Issues**

### Issue 1: Network/CORS Errors

**Console shows:**
```
❌ CORS policy blocked
❌ Failed to fetch
```

**Check:**
1. Is ngrok URL correct in `.env.local`?
2. Is ngrok still running?
3. Try accessing URL directly: `https://9776907978a6.ngrok-free.app/otp/transmodel/v3`

**Test API directly:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://9776907978a6.ngrok-free.app/otp/transmodel/v3 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"{ __typename }"}'
```

Expected: `{"data":{"__typename":"QueryType"}}`

### Issue 2: Schema/GraphQL Errors

**Console shows:**
```
❌ Cannot query field 'modes' on type 'TripQuery'
```

**Solution:**
Open GraphiQL to check schema:
```
https://9776907978a6.ngrok-free.app/graphiql
```

Compare our queries with what the schema expects.

### Issue 3: No Routes (But APIs Work)

**Console shows:**
```
✅ Transmodel Response: { trip: { tripPatterns: [] } }
✅ GTFS Response: { plan: { itineraries: [] } }
📊 Results: { combinedCount: 0 }
```

**This means:**
- ✅ APIs are responding
- ❌ No routes exist for those coordinates

**Solutions:**
1. Use coordinates within CDO area (8.4-8.5 lat, 124.6-124.7 lon)
2. Try closer locations (< 5km apart)
3. Check if GTFS data loaded in OTP
4. Try different departure time

### Issue 4: Invalid Coordinates

**Console shows:**
```
🎯 Starting route planning: { 
  from: { lat: undefined, lon: undefined }
}
```

**Solution:**
- Click map or use search to set coordinates
- Verify coordinates show below search boxes

## 📋 **Quick Checklist**

Before reporting issues, check:

- [ ] **Dev server restarted** after changes
- [ ] **Browser console open** (F12)
- [ ] **Both From & To set** (coordinates show below inputs)
- [ ] **At least one routing toggle enabled** (TM or GTFS)
- [ ] **ngrok URL correct** in `.env.local`
- [ ] **Environment variables loaded** (check in console: `console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_OTP_BASE)`)

---

## 🎯 **Expected Working Flow**

1. **Set From**: Click map or search → See coordinates: `8.472152, 124.616295`
2. **Set To**: Click map or search → See coordinates: `8.487033, 124.638092`
3. **Click "Get Routes"**
4. **Console shows**:
   - 🎯 Starting...
   - 🚀 Requests sent
   - ✅ Responses received
   - 📊 Results combined
   - ✅ Successfully planned N routes
5. **UI shows**:
   - Itinerary cards at bottom
   - Polylines on map
   - Can hover/click routes

---

## 📁 **Files Modified**

1. ✅ `src/lib/otp.ts` - Added ngrok headers + logging
2. ✅ `src/components/Controls.tsx` - Enhanced error handling + logging
3. ✅ `src/vite-env.d.ts` - TypeScript environment definitions
4. ✅ `tsconfig.json` - Include vite-env.d.ts

---

## 🐛 **Still Not Working?**

If after restart you still see "No routes found":

### Share These from Console:
1. The 🎯 Starting message (shows your coordinates)
2. The 🚀 Request messages (shows what's being sent)
3. Any ❌ Error messages (shows what failed)
4. The 📊 Results message (shows counts)

### Also Share:
- What coordinates you used
- Which routing engines are enabled
- Screenshot of the error message

With this info, I can pinpoint exactly what's wrong!

---

## ✅ **Build Status**

```bash
✓ Build successful
✓ No TypeScript errors
✓ No linter warnings
✓ ngrok headers added
✓ Console logging added
✓ Error handling improved
```

---

## 🎉 **What Should Happen Now**

After restart:
1. **Console will show detailed logs** of everything
2. **Error messages will be specific** (not generic)
3. **You'll see exactly what's failing** and why
4. **If APIs work but no routes**, you'll know it's a data/coordinates issue
5. **If APIs fail**, you'll see the exact error

**The enhanced logging will tell us exactly what's wrong!** 🎯

**REMEMBER: Restart dev server, then try again with console open!**

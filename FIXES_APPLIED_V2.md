# Fixes Applied - Version 2

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Dark Mode Functionality

**Problem**: Dark mode was not working properly

**Solution**:
- Added dark mode CSS to `src/styles.css`:
  ```css
  .dark {
    color-scheme: dark;
  }
  .dark body {
    background-color: #111827;
    color: #f9fafb;
  }
  ```
- Added `dark:` Tailwind classes throughout all components
- Components updated:
  - `Home.tsx` - Background, text, borders
  - `EnhancedSearchBar.tsx` - Input, dropdown, all text
  - `RouteCard.tsx` - Card background, text, borders
  - All UI elements now support dark mode

**How to test**:
1. Go to Settings
2. Click "Dark" theme
3. All UI elements should now display in dark colors

### 2. ✅ Route Selection Error Fixed

**Problem**: Clicking a route option caused infinite re-rendering

**Solution**:
- Fixed the `useEffect` dependency issue in `Home.tsx`
- Added `autoSearchTriggered` state to prevent infinite loops:
  ```typescript
  const [autoSearchTriggered, setAutoSearchTriggered] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (from && to && !autoSearchTriggered) {
      setAutoSearchTriggered(true);
      handlePlanRoute();
    } else if (!from || !to) {
      setAutoSearchTriggered(false);
    }
  }, [from, to, autoSearchTriggered]);
  ```

**How to test**:
1. Search for locations (From and To)
2. Click "Plan Route"
3. Click on any route card
4. No errors should occur, route should be selected properly

---

### 3. ✅ Type Location Feature

**Already Working** - The `EnhancedSearchBar` component already supports typing:
- Type in the From or To input fields
- Autocomplete suggestions appear
- Select from the dropdown

**How to test**:
1. Click in "From" field
2. Type "SM" or "Cogon"
3. See autocomplete results
4. Click to select

---

### 4. ✅ Click on Map to Select Location

**Problem**: Feature didn't exist

**Solution**:
- Added "Pick on map" button to each search field
- Enhanced `MapClickHandler` in `MapView.tsx`:
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (pickingMode) {
      map.getContainer().style.cursor = 'crosshair';
    } else {
      map.getContainer().style.cursor = '';
    }
  }, [pickingMode, map]);
  ```
- When in picking mode, clicking the map sets the location
- Cursor changes to crosshair when in picking mode

**How to test**:
1. Click the blue "Pick on map" button next to From or To label
2. Map cursor changes to crosshair
3. Click anywhere on the map
4. Location is set with coordinates

---

### 5. ✅ Map is Now Moveable/Draggable

**Problem**: Map interaction might have been limited

**Solution**:
- Explicitly enabled all map interactions in `MapView.tsx`:
  ```typescript
  <MapContainer
    dragging={true}
    touchZoom={true}
    scrollWheelZoom={true}
    doubleClickZoom={true}
  >
  ```

**How to test**:
1. Click and drag on the map - it should pan
2. Use mouse wheel - it should zoom in/out
3. Double-click - it should zoom in
4. On mobile - pinch to zoom, swipe to pan

## Developer Notes

### Dark Mode Implementation
All components use Tailwind's `dark:` variant:
```tsx
className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100"
```

### State Management
- `pickingMode` in `usePlanStore` controls map picking
- `autoSearchTriggered` in `Home` prevents loops
- All state properly synced

### Map Click Flow
```
User clicks "Pick on map" 
  → setPickingMode('from' | 'to')
  → Cursor changes to crosshair
  → User clicks map
  → MapClickHandler captures click
  → setFrom/setTo with coordinates
  → setPickingMode(null)
  → Cursor returns to normal
```

## Deployment Notes

All changes are backward compatible. No breaking changes. Users can:
- Continue using existing features
- Type locations (as before)
- Use new map picking feature
- Use new dark mode
- Map is now fully interactive
